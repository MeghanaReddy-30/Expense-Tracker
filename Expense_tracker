# Expense Analytics with Random Forest

This project builds a machine learning model to analyze company expenses and predict the **Payment Status** of invoices using a Random Forest classifier. The dataset contains around **60,000 rows** and **27 columns**, including financial, vendor, and budgeting information.

## Dataset

Each row represents a single expense or invoice record. Key columns:

- Department  
- Expense Category  
- Sub-Category  
- Vendor Name  
- Vendor Type  
- Invoice Amount  
- Payment Status *(target for classification)*  
- Payment Date  
- Invoice Date  
- Cost Center  
- Project/Initiative ID  
- Approval Level  
- Currency  
- Tax Amount  
- Recurring Expense Flag  
- Payment Method  
- Contract Duration  
- Cost Variance  
- Seasonal/Quarter Tag  
- Expense Description  
- cost_category  
- expense_frequency  
- historical_avg_spend_dept  
- budget_allocated  
- budget_remaining  
- Total Expenses  
- Total Revenue  

> If you want to predict a different target (for example, `cost_category` or `Total Expenses`), update the `target_col` variable in the code.
